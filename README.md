## More about me
I'm proficient with CSS and JavaScript, with extensive knowledge of UX and user psychology and the ability of building convenient and competitive style libraries that help boosting the conversion of any existing layouts entirely with improved design and code.

I have an advanced experience of MVC & RESTFul APIs || gRPCs built-upon Node env and able to deal with heavy backend user requests, distribute them accross multiple servers using reverse proxies and load balancers (HA), and link them to the front-end layouts and databases using popular frontend js frameworks && APIs.

I was a former passionate and curious graphic guru with unlimited imaginary in producing unique design layouts, creative key visuals. All that stems from the creative art direction and 10+ years of awesome experiences and agency backgrounds locally and internationally in creative advertising and marketing communications.

I'm an eloquently creator of impressive identity design styleguides, brand positionings, and brandss visual aspects. I'm a concept developer and marketing communications expert.

I'm optimist about having the opportunity to produce useful technologies that help solving problems for humanity. And big striker in solving competitive programming challenges under very strict rules and constraints... Yet still consider myself don't know programming well and will keep spending my whole life learning it!

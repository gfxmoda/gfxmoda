I'm extensively familiar with building different data structures' types and traversing them using the suitable algorithms in C++ and JavaScript with Intermediate knowledge of the well known JavaScript design patterns.

I write of meaningful, reliable, scalable, and reusable code that's based on OOP and its deep level of encapsulation, destructuring, and polymorphism.

My motto is:
